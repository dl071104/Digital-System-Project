8x8 Matrix Multiplication, Square Root Solver for Integer <br>
•	**Integer Square Root Computation:** Developed an FPGA-based square root calculator in Verilog using the iterative odd-integer subtraction algorithm. Integrated a 16×8 RAM for intermediate storage and drove results to on-board HEX displays for real-time visualization.
<br>
•	**Matrix Multiplication in Hardware:** Designed and implemented an 8×8 matrix multiplier in Verilog using a systolic array for efficient spatial data flow. Leveraged parallelism and dual-port memory to improve throughput and reduce latency. Achieved timing closure by analyzing and correcting setup/hold violations.
