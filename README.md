Square Root Solver for Integer <br>
•	**Integer Square Root Computation:** Developed an FPGA-based square root calculator in Verilog using the iterative odd-integer subtraction algorithm. Integrated a 16×8 RAM for intermediate storage and drove results to on-board HEX displays for real-time visualization.
